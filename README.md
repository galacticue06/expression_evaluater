# expression_evaluater
Version(0.0.1)
-
Initial release of expression_evaluater.


What's Available
-
- Functions, constants and some basic operands(+,-,*,/,%,^)

- Comparison expressions(==,>=,<=,!=,<,>)

- Depth analyzer 

Upcoming
-
As this is the initial release, it isn't certain if the project will continue(until I graduate). For that reason, I can't provide any upcoming feature at this stage.


CONTRIBUTION
-
I'm not currently looking for someone to contribute, however reporting bugs and issues would be appreciated. 
If you want to continue the development of the project individually, you can fork it.
